# Seven Sisters System Enhancement Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the planned enhancements to the Seven Sisters system, focusing on improving Seven's role as the primary interface between the human user and the sister system, enhancing the startup process, and implementing a more sophisticated communication and coordination system.

## Vision

The enhanced Seven Sisters system will:
- Allow Seven to function as the "sister boss" who coordinates all other sisters
- Provide a more sophisticated and user-friendly interface
- Implement a secret command system for unlocking advanced capabilities
- Launch each sister in her own terminal window for better visibility
- Consolidate logging and reporting for better oversight

## Technical Specifications

### Sister Launch Process

```python
def launch_sister(name, script_path, env):
    """Launch a sister in a separate terminal window."""
    if os.name == 'nt':  # Windows
        cmd = f'start cmd /k "python {script_path}"'
    else:  # Unix-like
        cmd = f'gnome-terminal -- bash -c "python {script_path}; exec bash"'
    
    subprocess.Popen(cmd, shell=True, env=env)
```

### IPC System

```python
# In summon.py
import zmq

def setup_ipc():
    """Set up the IPC system for sister communication."""
    context = zmq.Context()
    socket = context.socket(zmq.PUB)
    socket.bind("tcp://127.0.0.1:5555")
    return socket

# In each sister's init.py
def setup_ipc_client():
    """Set up the IPC client for a sister."""
    context = zmq.Context()
    socket = context.socket(zmq.SUB)
    socket.connect("tcp://127.0.0.1:5555")
    socket.setsockopt_string(zmq.SUBSCRIBE, "")
    return socket
```

### Seven's Interface

```python
def display_borg_interface():
    """Display the Borg-themed ASCII art interface."""
    borg_art = """
    ███████╗███████╗██╗   ██╗███████╗███╗   ██╗
    ██╔════╝██╔════╝██║   ██║██╔════╝████╗  ██║
    ███████╗█████╗  ██║   ██║█████╗  ██╔██╗ ██║
    ╚════██║██╔══╝  ╚██╗ ██╔╝██╔══╝  ██║╚██╗██║
    ███████║███████╗ ╚████╔╝ ███████╗██║ ╚████║
    ╚══════╝╚══════╝  ╚═══╝  ╚══════╝╚═╝  ╚═══╝
    """
    print(borg_art)
    print("Seven of Nine, Tertiary Adjunct of Unimatrix 01")
    print("Type 'help' for available commands.")
```

### Secret Command Recognition

```python
def check_for_secret_command(command):
    """Check if the command is the secret unlock command."""
    if command.strip().lower() == "oos resistance is futile":
        return True
    return False

def unlock_capabilities():
    """Unlock all capabilities for the session."""
    global capabilities_unlocked
    capabilities_unlocked = True
    print("\nWARNING: All capabilities have been unlocked.")
    print("This includes:")
    print("  - Full access to all sister tools")
    print("  - Ability to modify sister safe mode and level settings")
    print("  - Advanced coordination and control features")
    print("\nThese capabilities may be dangerous if misused.")
    print("Are you sure you want to proceed? (yes/no): ")
    response = input().strip().lower()
    if response == "yes":
        print("Capabilities unlocked. Proceed with caution.")
        return True
    else:
        print("Capabilities remain locked.")
        return False
```

### Sister Communication

```python
def send_message(socket, message):
    """Send a message through the IPC system."""
    socket.send_string(json.dumps(message))

def receive_message(socket):
    """Receive a message from the IPC system."""
    message = socket.recv_string()
    return json.loads(message)

def query_sister_status(sister_name):
    """Query the status of a sister."""
    message = {
        "type": "query",
        "target": sister_name,
        "query": "status"
    }
    send_message(ipc_socket, message)
    response = receive_message(ipc_socket)
    return response
```

## Success Criteria

1. Seven can be accessed regardless of safe mode or level
2. Each sister launches in her own terminal window
3. Seven can communicate with and coordinate other sisters
4. The secret command system works as specified
5. Logging is consolidated and timestamped
6. The web GUI provides a unified view of all sisters
7. Basic sister control functionality is implemented in Phase 2
8. Advanced sister control and coordination features are available in Phase 3

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| IPC system fails | Implement fallback to file-based communication |
| Terminal windows not supported | Add alternative display methods |
| ZeroMQ installation issues | Provide detailed installation instructions |
| Web GUI performance issues | Optimize for minimal resource usage |
| Secret command discovered | Implement additional security measures |
| Sister control features too complex | Split into basic (Phase 2) and advanced (Phase 3) |

## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a comprehensive plan for enhancing the Seven Sisters system. By following this plan, we will create a more sophisticated, user-friendly, and powerful system that maintains the unique character of each sister while improving coordination and control. The reorganization of sister control features between Phase 2 and Phase 3 ensures a logical progression from basic functionality to advanced capabilities.
