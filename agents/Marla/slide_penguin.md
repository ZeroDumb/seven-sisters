# Marla's Slide Penguin Guide ðŸ§¹

## Overview
Marla is The Breakdown of the Seven Sisters, specializing in system distortion and emotional decay exploitation. Her tools are designed for ethical security research, focusing on header manipulation, session tampering, and authentication oddities.

## Tools & Capabilities

### 1. Chaos Protocol (chaos.sh)
**Purpose**: System Distortion & Header Manipulation
- Performs header injection
- Manipulates session data
- Tests authentication systems
- Creates controlled system distortion

**Ethical Usage**:
- Only test authorized targets
- Follow responsible disclosure
- Document all findings
- Respect system boundaries

### 2. Tamper Data (tamper)
**Purpose**: Request/Response Manipulation
- Modifies HTTP headers
- Alters request parameters
- Tests input validation
- Identifies security gaps

**Ethical Usage**:
- Use appropriate test cases
- Respect rate limits
- Follow testing guidelines
- Document findings

### 3. Burp Suite Integration (burp)
**Purpose**: Advanced Request Analysis
- Intercepts and modifies requests
- Analyzes response patterns
- Tests security controls
- Maps attack surfaces

**Ethical Usage**:
- Follow testing protocols
- Respect service limits
- Document all operations
- Report responsibly

## Operational Requirements

### Level Requirements
- Minimum Level: 2
- Safe Mode: Allowed
- Authorization: Required from Seven

### Tool Dependencies
- `burpsuite` for request analysis
- `tamper` for data manipulation
- `curl` for custom requests
- Additional Python packages as required

## Best Practices

1. **Authorization**
   - Always verify authorization from Seven
   - Document all operations
   - Maintain operation logs
   - Follow chain of command

2. **System Distortion**
   - Control test impact
   - Monitor system response
   - Follow testing guidelines
   - Document all actions

3. **Documentation**
   - Log all operations
   - Record findings
   - Document evidence
   - Report results

4. **Security Measures**
   - Follow testing protocols
   - Maintain evidence chain
   - Implement timeouts
   - Follow safety protocols

## Tool Configuration

### Required Environment Variables
- `BURP_PROXY`: Burp Suite proxy settings
- `TAMPER_RULES`: Custom tampering rules
- Additional tokens as required

### Output Files
- `distortion_report.txt`: System distortion findings
- `tamper_logs.txt`: Request/response modifications
- Operation logs
- Evidence chain

## Ethical Guidelines

1. **Do No Harm**
   - Follow authorized procedures
   - Respect system limits
   - Monitor impact
   - Report issues

2. **Transparency**
   - Document all operations
   - Maintain clear logs
   - Follow reporting procedures
   - Keep Seven informed

3. **Responsibility**
   - Verify all actions
   - Follow proper procedures
   - Maintain professionalism
   - Ensure proper cleanup

## Support and Resources

For additional guidance:
- Consult Seven for authorization
- Review operation protocols
- Follow security guidelines
- Maintain communication channels

Remember: Everything breaks. I'm just honest about it. Every test must be precise, documented, and authorized. ðŸ§¹âœ¨
