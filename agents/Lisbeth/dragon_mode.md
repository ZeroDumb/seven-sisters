# Lisbeth's Dragon Mode Guide ðŸ‘»

## Overview
Lisbeth is the silent blade of the Seven Sisters, specializing in stealth operations and vulnerability assessment. Her tools are designed for ethical security testing, focusing on quiet reconnaissance, vulnerability scanning, and exploit verification.

## Tools & Capabilities

### 1. Ghost Protocol (ghost.sh)
**Purpose**: Stealth Operations
- Executes silent network scanning
- Performs vulnerability assessment
- Runs exploit verification
- Maintains operational security

**Ethical Usage**:
- Only execute on authorized targets
- Follow responsible disclosure
- Document all findings
- Maintain operational security

### 2. Network Mapping (nmap)
**Purpose**: Silent Network Reconnaissance
- Performs service version detection
- Maps network topology
- Identifies open ports
- Maintains low profile

**Ethical Usage**:
- Use appropriate scan speeds
- Respect network policies
- Follow scanning guidelines
- Document findings

### 3. Vulnerability Assessment (nuclei)
**Purpose**: Security Testing
- Identifies known vulnerabilities
- Verifies security issues
- Generates detailed reports
- Maintains evidence chain

**Ethical Usage**:
- Follow responsible disclosure
- Verify findings thoroughly
- Document all evidence
- Report responsibly

### 4. HTTP Analysis (httpx)
**Purpose**: Web Service Assessment
- Analyzes HTTP services
- Identifies web technologies
- Maps service endpoints
- Maintains stealth

**Ethical Usage**:
- Respect rate limits
- Follow web policies
- Document findings
- Report responsibly

### 5. XSS Testing (xsstrike)
**Purpose**: Web Vulnerability Testing
- Tests for XSS vulnerabilities
- Verifies security issues
- Generates proof of concept
- Maintains evidence chain

**Ethical Usage**:
- Follow responsible disclosure
- Verify findings thoroughly
- Document all evidence
- Report responsibly

## Operational Requirements

### Level Requirements
- Minimum Level: 4
- Safe Mode: Not Allowed
- Authorization: Required from Seven

### Tool Dependencies
- `nmap` for network scanning
- `nuclei` for vulnerability testing
- `httpx` for HTTP analysis
- `xsstrike` for XSS testing
- Python 3.x for automation

## Best Practices

1. **Authorization**
   - Always verify authorization from Seven
   - Document all operations
   - Maintain operation logs
   - Follow chain of command

2. **Stealth Operations**
   - Maintain low profile
   - Use appropriate timing
   - Follow OPSEC guidelines
   - Document all actions

3. **Documentation**
   - Log all operations
   - Record findings
   - Document evidence
   - Report results

4. **Security Measures**
   - Follow OPSEC protocols
   - Maintain evidence chain
   - Implement timeouts
   - Follow safety protocols

## Tool Configuration

### Required Environment Variables
- `NMAP_TIMING`: Scan timing template
- `NUCLEI_SEVERITY`: Minimum severity level
- Additional tokens as required

### Output Files
- `scan_nmap.txt`: Network scan results
- `nuclei_report.txt`: Vulnerability findings
- Operation logs
- Evidence chain

## Ethical Guidelines

1. **Do No Harm**
   - Follow authorized procedures
   - Respect system limits
   - Monitor impact
   - Report issues

2. **Transparency**
   - Document all operations
   - Maintain clear logs
   - Follow reporting procedures
   - Keep Seven informed

3. **Responsibility**
   - Verify all actions
   - Follow proper procedures
   - Maintain professionalism
   - Ensure proper cleanup
