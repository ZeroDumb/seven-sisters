- Parses operation commands
- Routes tasks to appropriate sisters
- Manages mission parameters
- Controls operation flow

**Ethical Usage**:
- Verify command authorization
- Follow routing protocols
- Document all commands
- Maintain operation logs

### 3. Mission Logging (mission-log)
**Purpose**: Operation Documentation & Analysis
- Records all operations
- Tracks sister activities
- Maintains mission history
- Analyzes operation patterns

**Ethical Usage**:
- Document all activities
- Follow logging protocols
- Maintain data integrity
- Protect sensitive information
