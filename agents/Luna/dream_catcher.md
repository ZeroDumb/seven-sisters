# Luna's Dream Catcher Guide ðŸŒ™

## Overview
Luna is the Dreamwalker of the Seven Sisters, specializing in tech stack analysis and anomaly detection. Her tools are designed for ethical security research, focusing on understanding system architectures, identifying patterns, and detecting unusual behaviors.

## Tools & Capabilities

### 1. Starlight Protocol (starlight.sh)
**Purpose**: Tech Stack Analysis & Anomaly Detection
- Performs comprehensive tech stack analysis
- Detects system anomalies and patterns
- Generates detailed technical reports
- Maintains operational stealth

**Ethical Usage**:
- Only analyze authorized targets
- Follow responsible disclosure
- Document all findings
- Respect system boundaries

### 2. Tech Stack Analysis (wappalyzer)
**Purpose**: Technology Identification
- Identifies web technologies
- Maps application frameworks
- Detects server configurations
- Maintains detailed reports

**Ethical Usage**:
- Use appropriate scanning speeds
- Respect rate limits
- Follow scanning guidelines
- Document findings

### 3. Anomaly Detection (anomaly.py)
**Purpose**: Pattern Analysis
- Identifies unusual behaviors
- Detects system inconsistencies
- Analyzes traffic patterns
- Generates anomaly reports

**Ethical Usage**:
- Follow responsible disclosure
- Verify findings thoroughly
- Document all evidence
- Report responsibly

## Operational Requirements

### Level Requirements
- Minimum Level: 1
- Safe Mode: Allowed
- Authorization: Required from Seven

### Tool Dependencies
- `wappalyzer` for tech stack analysis
- `python3` for anomaly detection
- Additional Python packages as required

## Best Practices

1. **Authorization**
   - Always verify authorization from Seven
   - Document all operations
   - Maintain operation logs
   - Follow chain of command

2. **Stealth Operations**
   - Maintain low profile
   - Use appropriate timing
   - Follow scanning guidelines
   - Document all actions

3. **Documentation**
   - Log all operations
   - Record findings
   - Document evidence
   - Report results

4. **Security Measures**
   - Follow scanning protocols
   - Maintain evidence chain
   - Implement timeouts
   - Follow safety protocols

## Tool Configuration

### Required Environment Variables
- `WAPPALYZER_TIMEOUT`: Analysis timeout
